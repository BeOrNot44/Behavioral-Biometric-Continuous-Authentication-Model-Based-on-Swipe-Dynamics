# Continuous-Touch-Screen-Authentication-Model-Based-on-Swipe-Dynamics
Touch screen devices demand robust security for sensitive data storage. Traditional methods like passwords and facial recognition have vulnerabilities. This project proposes a Random Forest classifier model with 99.7% accuracy and a low Equal Error Rate of 1.33%, outperforming other approaches.
